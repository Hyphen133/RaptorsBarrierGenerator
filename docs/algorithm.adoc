= Raptors Barrier Generator Algorithm
---

The overall goal of this algorithm is to take unprocessed image of map and convert
it into regions that robot cannot access.

== Input data

=== Imaga data

Image consists of 3 types of pixels:

* [black]#*Black pixels*# - representing walls
* [gray]#*Gray pixels*# - representing area outside of building boundary
* [white]#*White pixels*# - respresenting area which robot can move

=== Robot's starting position

IMPORTANT: Because of the fact that robot will be not able to enter specific positions,
*accessible positions always depend on starting point*.

Suppose we example presented on image below where we have 2 areas that have been returned from algorithm.
From one we cannot pass to the other. In this case if robot starts in [yellow]#*yellow region*# it will be able to move only in yellow regions.
It is analogical with [blue]#*blue regions*#.

=== Robot shape information

IMPORTANT: The assumption at this point is that we take the largest width of robot as the shape information

== Extraction of boundaries between accessible and inaccessible part

=== Problems and motiviations

Due to the fact that input image is not in perfect condition we need to make clear division between impassable part
and the part that can be accessed by robot.

This problem is at the outer boundary of image. Boundary of outer image can currently have 2 forms. The former is between black and white parts,
whereas the latter is between gray and white regions

Furthermore the additional problem solved to local file by this module are small holes in black boundary.

=== Solution and output

The solution involves using usage of multiple filters both to fill small holes and extract boundary.
It can be accessed in link:../src/map_processing/map_processing.py[following location].

The *output image* contains of:

* *Black pixels* - represent boundaries
* [white]#*White pixels*# - respresenting other regions than boundaries

== Extracting polygons

=== Motivation

Polygons will be much easier to work with and are required for finding regions with current algorithm.

=== Output

Because boundaries have non-zero width we have to include 2 additional concepts, which are *inner and outer boundaries*.
That part of algorithm returns all polygons with their inner and outer boundaries *as polygons*.

== Finding lines that robot won't be able to pass

=== Problems and motiviations

This is the key problem of the algorithm to find places which actually the robot won't be able to pass though.

=== Detection of impassable lines based on polygonized boundaries


=== Ouput

== Finding regions that robot won't be access from one another

=== Region extraction based on boundaries

==== Segmentation
The solution used currently extracts segmentation map based on Felzenszwalb algorithm.

==== Merging of small regions

Because of the fact that segmentation may leave some small regions additional mergin needs to be done

==== Final merging based on intial position of robot
Final merging collects all regions that are not the one in which robot can move into larger ones and polygonizes those.

=== Ouput
The output of the module is the polygonized boundaries of all separate regions that cannot be accessed based on given starting point position.
